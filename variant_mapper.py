class VariantMapper:
    """
    This class is for handling the conversion between plate barcodes
    and variant letters.

    Plate barcodes contain the variant information in the form of a
    2 digit number. These numbers are sequential pairs which are the
    two replicates associated with the same variant. i.e [01, 02] are
    associated with variant "a", [03, 04] for variant "b" etc.
    The two-digits are the 2nd and 3rd character in the plate barcode.
    e.g "S0399" has the variant integer 03.

    The neutralisation launcher records variants in the form of a single
    lower case letter. These letters are simply in alphabetical order
    and have no relation to the greek letters assigned to variants by the
    WHO. They are to simplify storing which variants have been analysed per
    workflow ID without having to use the Serology LIMS database.

    The actual variant names can be found in the LIMS serology database in
    the `NE_available_strains` table. Which maps the variant name with
    the pairs of plate integers.

    Overall there is a mapping of:
        `variant_letter` <=> `plate_integer` <=> `variant_name`
              `a`        <=>      `01`       <=>   `England2`
